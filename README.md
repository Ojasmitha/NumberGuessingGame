# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple number guessing game where players have to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The game consists of three HTML pages:
- `index.html`: This is the main page where the game starts. It allows players to input their guesses and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses the correct number, they are directed to the "Congrats!" page. If they exhaust all their attempts without guessing correctly, they are directed to the "You lost. Try Again" page.
- `win.html`: This page displays a congratulatory message when the player successfully guesses the number.
- `lose.html`: This page informs the player that they have lost the game and invites them to try again.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field provided and click the "START" button.
3. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
4. If you guess the number correctly, you'll be directed to the "Congrats!" page.
5. If you exhaust all your attempts without guessing correctly, you'll be directed to the "You lost. Try Again" page.

Have fun playing!
